# 🌐 Ula's Personal Website

Hi there! 👋 I'm Ula — a curious and creative Project Coordinator with a growing passion for tech and development. This personal [website](https://ulszka.com) is my space to showcase who I am, what I do, and what I love — from my professional journey to the side projects that keep me inspired.

## 💼 About This Website

This site was built to highlight:

- 🧠 My job experience — including both IT projects and civil engineering and 
- 🎓 My education and learning journey
- 🎮 A few browser-based games I built using **React** and **AI-assisted coding**
- 🌱 My hobbies and things I do after hours

I developed the front end myself using **React (TypeScript + TSX)** and **SCSS**, with support from AI tools and a back-end developer who helped with the server and CI/CD setup. Every piece was crafted with learning, creativity, and fun in mind.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- React (with TypeScript & TSX)
- SCSS for styling
- AI tools (like ChatGPT & Copilot) for idea generation and coding support
- Git & GitHub for version control
- CI/CD GitHub Actions

## 🛠 Projects & Games

Inside the site, you’ll find a few small games I developed — including a **Snake clone** — built from scratch and powered by AI-assisted logic to bring old-school fun to the browser.

## 🤝 Let's Connect

This repo and site are more than just a portfolio — they're an open door. If you're curious about my work, want to collaborate, or just say hi, feel free to reach out!
